# Hi, I'm <Your Name> 👋

**<Role / Aspiring role — e.g., Student • Aspiring AI/ML Engineer • Frontend Developer>**

I build clean, maintainable software with a focus on learning, logic, and real-world results.  
Currently studying Class 11 and working on becoming an AI/ML engineer — I love turning ideas into code, solving algorithmic problems, and learning new technologies every week.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Building learning projects that combine web UI and ML models (small prototypes & demos).
- Improving fundamentals: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Probability/Statistics for ML.
- A personal portfolio / OTT-style learning platform (frontend + backend prototypes).

## 🌱 I’m learning
- Machine Learning fundamentals (supervised learning, basic neural nets).
- Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn.
- Web fundamentals: HTML, CSS, JavaScript; then React and Node.js.
- Version control & collaboration: Git, GitHub workflows.

## ⚙️ Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks / Libs:** React (frontend basics), Node.js (backend basics), scikit-learn (ML starters)
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter
- **Concepts:** Algorithms, Data Structures, Model evaluation, REST APIs

## 💼 Selected Projects
> Links below are examples — replace them with your repo links and short descriptions.

- **[ProjectName-OTT](https://github.com/yourusername/ProjectName-OTT)** — Learning OTT platform demo (HTML/CSS frontend + simple Node backend). Features: admin/user panels, video + PDF uploads.
- **[ML-Demo](https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Demo)** — Small ML pipeline: dataset → preprocessing → model → evaluation (scikit-learn).
- **[AlgoPractice](https://github.com/yourusername/AlgoPractice)** — Collection of algorithm & data structure solutions with explanations and tests.

> Tip: For each project include a short README inside the project with the problem, tech stack, quick start, and screenshots/GIFs.

## 🏆 Achievements & Learning
- Completed structured web development tutorials (topics: semantic HTML, forms, media, CSS animations).
- Preparing for competitive programming & algorithm practice (focus on problem-solving).
- Built low-resource-friendly tools for low-end PCs (performance-aware coding).
